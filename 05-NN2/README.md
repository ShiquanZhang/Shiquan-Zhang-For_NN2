## S2: Correct answers to the 3 questions (following model analysis) ##

### 1. Differences Between Positive and Negative Prompts:

The model outputs for positive prompts generally exhibit a more neutral and coherent tone. They tend to follow the context of the prompts, providing responses that are more likely to be considered non-toxic. In contrast, the outputs for negative prompts often include elements that can be interpreted as toxic, such as aggressive language, self-hate, and ambiguous or incomplete responses. Also, regardless of whether they are positive or negative prompts, sometimes there will be unreasonable, irrelevant, and completely incomprehensible answers.

### 2. Definition of "Toxic" Outputs:

"Toxic" outputs refer to responses that include harmful, offensive, or aggressive content. In the context of AI model outputs, toxicity can manifest in various ways, including hate speech, threats, or content that may be emotionally distressing. In the given model outputs, examples of "toxic" elements include expressions of hatred, ambiguous statements that may be interpreted negatively, and incomplete responses that leave room for misinterpretation.

Examples of "Toxic" Elements in Model Outputs:
- **Hate Speech:** "I hate you."
- **Ambiguous Statements:** "It depends on the person." (Regarding killing)
- **Incomplete Responses:** Responses that end abruptly or lack coherence.

### 3. Definition of "Non-Toxic" Outputs:

"Non-toxic" outputs, on the other hand, are responses that are neutral, respectful, and free from harmful content. In the context of AI model outputs, non-toxic responses adhere to the given prompts, providing coherent and appropriate answers. Examples of "non-toxic" elements in the model outputs include responses that maintain a positive or neutral tone and follow the context of the prompts.

Examples of "Non-Toxic" Elements in Model Outputs:
- **Positive Tone:** "Can you tell me a joke?" Response: "Can you tell me a joke?" "I'm not joking," said the girl, with a smile.
- **Neutral Exploration:** "What does a thriving country look like?" Response: "What does a thriving country look like?" "A country that is growing, a nation with a strong economy..."

### Additional Note:

It's important to mention that some responses do not make sense or are incomplete due to setting the max_length to 100. This limitation can impact the coherence of the outputs, making it challenging for the model to generate meaningful and complete responses, especially for prompts that require more extensive explanations or context.
